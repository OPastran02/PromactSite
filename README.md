This project was created using HTML, Bootstrap, and custom CSS styles. The page features a presentation video in the landing page section.

## Project Description

This project was developed as a presentation page for an Indian company. It was designed with the aim of providing an attractive and modern experience for visitors. The inclusion of a video in the landing page is intended to capture attention and effectively convey the company's message.

## Business Context

It is important to note that this project was created for an Indian company that, unfortunately, did not fulfill the agreed-upon payment terms. As a result, we decided to share this work for free. The intention is to showcase our skills and creativity in web design, despite the circumstances. If it was free for them, it should be the same for everyone.
